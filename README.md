- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jon Freeman@Jons-Workshop
- Iâ€™m a Digital Systems Engineer, now retired but keeping my hand in with several hardware and software projects.
- Iâ€™m currently learning to use Git and GitHub !
- I intend to place all my code on GitHub partly to better organise my own stuff, and to give it away for free to anyone.
- Most of the code was created for ARM Cortex embedded systems, inc a number of brushless motor controllers
